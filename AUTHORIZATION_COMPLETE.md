# TYFOR-Coach Authorization System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The authorization system for the TYFOR-Coach application has been successfully implemented with role-based access control where logged-in users can only access and update Physical, Conditional, and Endurance data for teams they are responsible for.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Backend Authorization System
- **Authorization Service**: Complete implementation in `services/authorization_service.py`
  - User permission checking methods
  - Team and footballer access validation
  - Admin vs regular user differentiation

- **Middleware Enhancements**: Updated `middlewares/auth_middleware.py`
  - `@team_access_required`: Validates team access permissions
  - `@footballer_access_required`: Validates footballer access permissions  
  - Enhanced JWT tokens with `team_id` and `is_admin` fields

- **Service Layer Security**: All services updated with authorization
  - `services/physical_service.py`: User filtering and permission checks
  - `services/conditional_service.py`: Authorization controls
  - `services/endurance_service.py`: Authorization controls

- **Controller Layer Protection**: All controllers secured
  - `controllers/physical_dev_controller.py`: Middleware protection
  - `controllers/conditional_dev_controller.py`: Middleware protection
  - `controllers/endurance_dev_controller.py`: Middleware protection

- **Auth Service Enhancement**: Updated `services/auth_service.py`
  - Token generation includes `team_id` for user's assigned team
  - Token generation includes `is_admin` for role-based access

### Mobile App Authorization Integration
- **Auth Service Updates**: Enhanced `mobile/src/services/auth.js`
  - `isUserAdmin()`: Check current user admin status
  - `getCurrentUserTeamId()`: Get user's team ID from token

- **Service Layer Authorization**: All mobile services updated
  - `mobile/src/services/physicalService.js`: Permission-based filtering
  - `mobile/src/services/conditionalService.js`: Authorization integration
  - `mobile/src/services/enduranceService.js`: Authorization integration
  - Added `fetchUserAccessibleTeams()` to all services

- **Screen Updates**: All development screens secured
  - `mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js`: Admin status display
  - `mobile/src/screens/Development/PhysicalDevelopmentScreen.js`: Team filtering
  - `mobile/src/screens/Development/ConditionalDevelopmentScreen.js`: Authorization flow
  - `mobile/src/screens/Development/EnduranceDevelopmentScreen.js`: **‚úÖ COMPLETED**

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Role-Based Access Control
1. **Admin Users (`is_admin=True`)**:
   - Access to all teams and footballers
   - Can view and modify all data
   - League selection available

2. **Regular Users (`is_admin=False`)**:
   - Access only to their assigned team (`team_id`)
   - Cannot access other teams' data
   - Auto-selected to their team (no league selection needed)

### Authorization Middleware
- **`@token_required`**: Validates JWT token presence and validity
- **`@team_access_required`**: Ensures user can access specific team
- **`@footballer_access_required`**: Ensures user can access specific footballer
- **`@coach_required`**: Validates user has coaching permissions

### Data Filtering
- **Backend**: Services automatically filter data based on user permissions
- **Frontend**: Mobile app respects backend authorization and shows only accessible data
- **API Security**: All CRUD operations respect authorization rules

## üîß Technical Implementation

### JWT Token Enhancement
```javascript
// Token now includes:
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "team_id": 456,  // User's assigned team
  "is_admin": false, // Admin status
  "exp": timestamp
}
```

### API Endpoint Protection
```python
# Example endpoint protection:
@physical_bp.route('/footballers/<team_id>', methods=['GET'])
@token_required
@team_access_required
def get_footballers(team_id):
    # Implementation with authorization
```

### Mobile Authorization Flow
```javascript
// Example service method with authorization:
export const fetchFootballersByTeam = async (teamId) => {
  const currentUser = await getCurrentUser();
  const isAdmin = await isUserAdmin();
  
  // Check permissions before API call
  if (!isAdmin && currentUser?.team_id !== parseInt(teamId)) {
    throw new Error('You do not have permission to access this team\'s footballers');
  }
  
  return await get(`${ENDPOINTS.FOOTBALLERS}/${teamId}`);
};
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Admin User Flow
‚úÖ Admin can access all leagues
‚úÖ Admin can access all teams within any league
‚úÖ Admin can access all footballers within any team
‚úÖ Admin can create/read/update/delete all data

### Regular User Flow  
‚úÖ Regular user sees only their accessible teams
‚úÖ Regular user automatically sees their assigned team
‚úÖ Regular user cannot access other teams' data
‚úÖ Regular user can only modify data for their assigned team

### Security Validation
‚úÖ Unauthorized API access blocked with proper error messages
‚úÖ Token validation prevents access without authentication
‚úÖ Team/footballer access validation prevents cross-team data access
‚úÖ Frontend respects backend authorization rules

## üöÄ Ready for Production

### All Systems Operational
- ‚úÖ Backend authorization service
- ‚úÖ Middleware protection
- ‚úÖ Service layer filtering
- ‚úÖ Controller security
- ‚úÖ Mobile app integration
- ‚úÖ Screen authorization flows
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ No syntax errors detected

### Error Messages
Comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid tokens
- Unauthorized team access
- Unauthorized footballer access
- Missing permissions

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries with user filtering
- Minimal overhead for authorization checks
- Cached user permissions in JWT tokens

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Creating Users
```python
# Admin user
admin_user = User(
    username="admin",
    email="admin@tyfor.com", 
    team_id=None,  # Optional for admins
    is_admin=True
)

# Regular user (coach)
coach_user = User(
    username="coach1",
    email="coach1@tyfor.com",
    team_id=123,  # Must be assigned to specific team
    is_admin=False
)
```

### API Usage
```javascript
// All API calls automatically include authorization
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Log Monitoring
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- Track user permission changes
- Log team assignment modifications

### Database Integrity
- Ensure user.team_id references valid teams
- Maintain footballer.team_id consistency
- Regular permission audit recommended
